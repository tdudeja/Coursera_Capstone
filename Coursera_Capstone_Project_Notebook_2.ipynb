In this case, we use the following attributes/features for model training and evaluation.\n**Location, Weather Condition, Light conditions, Road conditions, Junction, People Count, Vehicle count**\n\nIn order not to create a biased ML model, we have balanced the data in this dataset. Moreso, we have done feature engineering in order to improve the predictibility of the model.\nWe have tried multiple Supervised ML algorithms and selected the one which offers the highest prediction accuracy.\n"
